Class notes for "5SSB0 -- Adaptive Information Processing" class. 

Plans for new 2015 course
--

- Readings in Bishop are mandatory
  - this relaxes the need for math in the slides, focus more on the skills and concepts, include more examples
- Do Bayesian treatment first (incl LaPlace) and only go to ML if computations get too difficult 
- Add factor graphs (ch.8 Bishop)
- Better set of exercises, including coding exercises (use idea of Iman: let students enter snippets of code to make it work
- Better connection to 2nd part
