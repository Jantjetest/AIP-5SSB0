    "### What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "- Machine Learning relates to **building models from data**\n",
    "  - Suppose we want to make a model for a complex process about which we have little knowledge (so hand-programming is not possible).\n",
    "  - **Solution**: Get the computer to program itself by showing it examples of the behavior that we want.\n",
    "  - Practically, we choose a library of models, and write a program that picks a model and tunes it to fit the data\n",
    "  - **Criterion**: a _good_ model generalizes well to unseen data from the same process.\n",
    "- This method is known in various scientific communities under different names such as machine learning, statistical inference, system identification, data mining, source coding, data compression, etc."
